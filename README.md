# Git Magic

## Learning Goals

- Use advanced git techniques

## Introduction

Git is one of the most powerful tools in your toolbelt. [Git Magic](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~blynn/gitmagic/) is a relatively quick guide to some of the more advanced features. It should take about 1.5 hours to read. It is a little short on exercises, so you should take care to add exercises of your own as you read.
